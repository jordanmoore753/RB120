21 is a two-player game that uses a 52-card deck. The player plays
against the dealer. The player goes first and draws cards until
they are close to 21 or are over 21. If the player goes over 21, they 
bust and automatically lose the round. If the player stays before 21, then 
the dealer draws his cards. He can bust or stay.
